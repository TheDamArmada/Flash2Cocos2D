To use the XCode example:

- You will have to follow the steps [here](http://www.tinytimgames.com/2011/07/22/cocos2d-and-arc/) to link Cocos2D ARC enabled to the project.
- You need to have CocoaPods installed (http://cocoapods.org/).  Imagine them as a cleaner way to submodule.  Open F2C_RobotTutorial using the .xcworkspace file, not xcodeproj.
